fastDBarcode
============

FastDBarcode is obsolete. [axe](https://github.com/kdmurray91/axe) is far more
accurate and faster. Anyone who used fastDBarcode is recommended to upgrade to
axe.

FastDBarcode is no longer supported, and may contain severe bugs.

For archival purposes:
----------------------

Split out 5' barcodes from fastq files, but quickly.

This is currently super-hacky, and definitely in alpha-version stage. It
doesn't really have tests yet (but will), and there are a few more things I'd
like it to do.

Still, Hope you find it useful.
